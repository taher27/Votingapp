Build voter/Dockerfile
Deploy voter/voter.yaml

And you can access roost-controlplane:30030 over a browser 
* For single-node cluster, try roost-worker instead of roost-controlplane
But this is just the UI


Build ballot/Dockerfile
Apply ballot/ballot.yaml to ZKE

And you can access roost-controlplane:30080 (GET)
